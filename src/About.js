            I have been many things in the past, an auto mechanic, a service
            advisor, a waiter, parking valet, apartment manager, and tech
            support.

            But what I have always wanted to be was a programmer. Ever since I
            typed my first line of code on my Commodore 64, I was hooked. I
            finally decided to take the plunge and go all in and enrolled in
            Flatiron coding bootcamp. Flatiron reignited my passion to code and
            has given me a great foundation to start my new journey. Iâ€™m excited
            to continue to learn and grow and share my passion to code.

            I'm currently working on improving my Javascript and React skills.
            Next on my list is PWA and Swift as I believe mobile is the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have any questions for me or if you have any suggestions on
            how I can improve on my code please don't hesitate to contact me.
